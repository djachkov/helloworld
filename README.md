# My personal project

Welcome to my personal leisure project.
The plan is to make a simple blog \ portfolio using interesting tools and technologies, such as:
 - Fast API as the backend service 
 - React (or not?) as the frontend foundation. 
 - ${THE_NEW_BIG_THING_NAME}
Oh, and play with GitHub actions 

Well, we'll see. The key idea is to check out the stuff I'm interested in and then wholly rewrite everything using some other technologies.

P.S. yeah, that's one more stillborn repository I'll delete a couple of months later without any commits.
